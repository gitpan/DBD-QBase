Things I'm going to do some day:

* Finish fixing Makefile.PL so it does not do  minor bothersome things. =)

*  Multiply Cursor support

* Clean up and document this beast

* Get help on fixing Perl5.x or my software to correctly beable to do
	dynamic loading of ObjC code.

* Command known to be currently broken:
    * commit
    * rollback
    * readblob
    * bind_param
