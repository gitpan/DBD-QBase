** Version .03 		Public Alpha **

No solution for dynamic loading problems.  Fetch works now with a limit of
20 columns per row. - GJ

$dbh->do now is executed to do memory management correct -GJ

Added test.pl from DBI...It gives out a lot of information (errors? =),  but
currently there is not debugging within the DBD so it's not as usefull.

Updated qb.pl with more tests and corrected it to say "test" and not
"ben" for use name. =)

Hacked Makefile.PL to setup everything correctly. (nearly. =)  You can
ignore the errors, hopefully, Makefile.PL spits out.

** Version .02 		First Public Alpha **

Can't resolve the ObjC and Perl dynamic loading problems, so I've moved to
a staticly linked DBI+DBD+Perl5 for my testing.  So far most things work
excluding anything returning data from the database and anything doing with
blobs.

** Version .01		First Semi-working alpha code  **

[No comments, internal alpha..Just getting the system to work =) ]
